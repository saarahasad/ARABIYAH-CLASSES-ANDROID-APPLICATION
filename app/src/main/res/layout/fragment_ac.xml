            android:text="We made a complete course specially designed for linguistic conversation. This is because a lot of students can write and read from books well. But they can’t speak or form thoughts about specific topics in Arabic very well. In this course, the student identifies the foundations of linguistic thinking, forming thoughts and using the appropriate words grammatically and rhetorically The course is based on specific content and topics the teachers offers the student in order for him to transform the thoughts into an Arabic eloquent spoken talk. The student also can suggest appropriate topics for him to speak about. That’s why this course is important to complete the sides of learning the Arabic language.

These lessons aim to increase vocabulary and break the barrier of fear of the language for the student.

Students train in the daily dialogues until they can speak it automatically if exposed to an unexpected position during practice.

The language and conversation lessons are designed by the teacher in a non-scheduled form according to the student's concerns, whether their interests are political, religious, tourism, business or other.

The lesson could be based on reading a book or a newspaper with the student making comments and giving their opinion.

During the conversation, the teacher corrects and writes down the errors the student makes and then the teacher asks the student to focus on a particular expression by placing it in a sentence or several sentences in Arabic.

This is prepared by the student as homework with the subject of the next debate."
